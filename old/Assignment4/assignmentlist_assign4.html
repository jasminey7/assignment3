			<h2>SCENE III. Venice. A street.</h2>

			<h4> Enter SHYLOCK, SALARINO, ANTONIO, and Gaoler</h4>
			<h4>SHYLOCK </h4>
			<p>Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;
			This is the fool that lent out money gratis:
			Gaoler, look to him.
			<h4>ANTONIO</h4>
			<p>Hear me yet, good Shylock.</p>
			<h4>SHYLOCK</h4>
			<p>I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:
			I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
			Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;
			But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:
			The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,
			Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
			To come abroad with him at his request. </p>
			<h4>ANTONIO</h4>
			<p>I pray thee, hear me speak.</p>
			<h4>SHYLOCK</h4>
			<p>I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:
			I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.
			I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,
			To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield
			To Christian intercessors. Follow not;
			I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.
			Exit</p>

			<h4>SALARINO</h4>
			<p>It is the most impenetrable cur
			That ever kept with men.
			</p>

			<h4>ANTONIO</h4>
			<p>Let him alone:
			I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
			He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
			I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
			Many that have at times made moan to me;
			Therefore he hates me.</p>

			<h4>SALARINO</h4>
			<p>I am sure the duke
			Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.</p>

			<h4>ANTONIO</h4>
			<p>The duke cannot deny the course of law:
			For the commodity that strangers have
			With us in Venice, if it be denied,
			Will much impeach the justice of his state;
			Since that the trade and profit of the city
			Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:
			These griefs and losses have so bated me,
			That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
			To-morrow to my bloody creditor.
			Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come
			To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!
			Exeunt</p>

		<h2>SCENE IV. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.</h2>

		<h4>Enter PORTIA, NERISSA, LORENZO, JESSICA, and BALTHASAR
		LORENZO</h4>
		<p>Madam, although I speak it in your presence,
		You have a noble and a true conceit
		Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly
		In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
		But if you knew to whom you show this honour,
		How true a gentleman you send relief,
		How dear a lover of my lord your husband,
		I know you would be prouder of the work
		Than customary bounty can enforce you.</p>

		<h4>PORTIA</h4>
		<p>I never did repent for doing good,
		Nor shall not now: for in companions
		That do converse and waste the time together,
		Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,
		There must be needs a like proportion
		Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;
		Which makes me think that this Antonio,
		Being the bosom lover of my lord,
		Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,
		How little is the cost I have bestow'd
		In purchasing the semblance of my soul
		From out the state of hellish misery!
		This comes too near the praising of myself;
		Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
		Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
		The husbandry and manage of my house
		Until my lord's return: for mine own part,
		I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
		Now lays upon you.</p>

		<h4>LORENZO</h4>
		<p>Madam, with all my heart;
		I shall obey you in all fair commands.</p>

		<h4>PORTIA</h4>
		<p>My people do already know my mind,
		And will acknowledge you and Jessica
		And so farewell, till we shall meet again.</p>

		<h4>LORENZO</h4>
		<p>Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!</p>

		<h4>JESSICA</h4>
		<p>I wish your ladyship all heart's content.</p>

		<h4>PORTIA</h4>
		<p>I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased
		To wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica.
		Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZO
		But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.</p>

		<h4>BALTHASAR</h4>
		<p>Madam, I go with all convenient speed.
		Exit</p>

		<h4>PORTIA</h4>
		<p>Come on, Nerissa; I have work in hand
		That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands
		Before they think of us.</p>

		<h4>NERISSA</h4>
		<p>Shall they see us?</p>

		<h4>PORTIA</h4>
		<p>They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,
		That they shall think we are accomplished
		With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,
		When we are both accoutred like young men,
		I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,
		And wear my dagger with the braver grace,
		And speak between the change of man and boy
		With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps
		Into a manly stride, and speak of frays
		Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,
		How honourable ladies sought my love,
		Which I denying, they fell sick and died;
		I could not do withal; then I'll repent,
		And wish for all that, that I had not killed them;
		And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,
		That men shall swear I have discontinued school
		Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind
		A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
		Which I will practise.</p>

		<h4>NERISSA</h4>
		<p>Why, shall we turn to men?</p>

		<h4>PORTIA</h4>
		<p>Fie, what a question's that,
		If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!
		But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device
		When I am in my coach, which stays for us
		At the park gate; and therefore haste away,
		For we must measure twenty miles to-day.
		Exeunt</p>

	<h2>SCENE V. The same. A garden.</h2>

	Enter LAUNCELOT and JESSICA
	<h4>LAUNCELOT</h4>
<p>Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father
are to be laid upon the children: therefore, I
promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with
you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:
therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you
are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do
you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard
hope neither.</p>
	<h4>JESSICA</h4>
<p>And what hope is that, I pray thee?</p>
	<h4>LAUNCELOT</h4>
<p>Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you
not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.</p>
	<h4>JESSICA</h4>
<p>That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the
sins of my mother should be visited upon me.</p>
	<h4>LAUNCELOT</h4>
<p>Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and
mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I
fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are
gone both ways.</p>
	<h4>JESSICA</h4>
<p>I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a
Christian.</p>
	<h4>LAUNCELOT</h4>
<p>Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians
enow before; e'en as many as could well live, one by
another. This making Christians will raise the
price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we
shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.
Enter LORENZO</p>
