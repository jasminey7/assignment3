<h2>The "New Santa" Was Based on a Salesman</h2>
<p>Haddon hubbard &quot;Sunny&quot; Sundblom was an American artist who painted the image of Santa using a live model — his friend Lou Prentiss, a retired salesman. When Prentiss passed away, Sundblom used himself as a model, painting while looking into a mirror. Finally, he began relying on photographs to create the image of St. Nick.</p>
<p>People loved the Coca-Cola Santa images and paid such close attention to them that when anything changed, they sent letters to The Coca-Cola Company. One year, Santa's large belt was backwards (perhaps because Sundblom was painting via a mirror). Another year, Santa Claus appeared without a wedding ring, causing fans to write asking what happened to Mrs. Claus.</p>
<p>The children who appear with Santa in Sundblom&rsquo;s paintings were based on Sundblom's neighbors — two little girls. So he changed one to a boy in his paintings.</p>
<p>The dog in Sundblom&rsquo;s 1964 Santa Claus painting was actually a gray poodle belonging to the neighborhood florist. But Sundblom wanted the dog to stand out in the holiday scene, so he painted the animal with black fur.</p>
