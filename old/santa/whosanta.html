<h1 >Who is Santa and how did he come to be the face of Coca Cola?</h1>

<p>In 1931 the company began placing Coca-Cola ads in popular magazines. Archie Lee, the D'Arcy Advertising Agency executive working with <a href="http://www.coca-colacompany.com/our-company/" data-cms-ai="1">The Coca-Cola Company</a>, wanted the campaign to show a wholesome Santa who was both realistic and symbolic. So <a href="http://www.coca-colacompany.com/brands/coca-cola/" data-cms-ai="1">Coca-Cola</a>commissioned Michigan-born illustrator Haddon Sundblom to develop advertising images using Santa Claus — showing Santa himself, not a man dressed as Santa.</p>
<p>For inspiration, Sundblom turned to Clement Clark Moore's 1822 poem "<a title="Link: http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/171924" href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/171924" data-cms-ai="1">A Visit From St. Nicholas</a>" (commonly called "'Twas the Night Before Christmas"). Moore's description of St. Nick led to an image of a warm, friendly, pleasantly plump and human Santa. (And even though it's often said that Santa wears a red coat because red is the color of <a href="http://www.coca-colacompany.com/brands/coca-cola/" data-cms-ai="1">Coca-Cola</a>, Santa appeared in a red coat before Sundblom painted him.)</p>


<p>Sundblom&rsquo;s Santa debuted in 1931 in Coke ads in The Saturday Evening Post and appeared regularly in that magazine, as well as in Ladies Home Journal, National Geographic, The New Yorker and others.</p>
<p>From 1931 to 1964, Coca-Cola advertising showed Santa delivering toys (and playing with them!), pausing to read a letter and enjoy a Coke, visiting with the children who stayed up to greet him, and raiding the refrigerators at a number of homes. The original oil paintings Sundblom created were adapted for Coca-Cola advertising in magazines and on store displays, billboards, posters, calendars and plush dolls. Many of those items today are popular<a href="http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/collectors-columns" data-cms-ai="1">collectibles</a>.</p>
<p>Sundblom created his final version of Santa Claus in 1964, but for several decades to follow,Coca-Cola advertising featured images of Santa based on Sundblom&rsquo;s original works. These paintings are some of the most prized pieces in the art collection in the company&rsquo;s archives department and have been on exhibit around the world, in famous locales including <a href="http://www.louvre.fr/en" data-cms-ai="1">the Louvre </a>in Paris, <a title="Link: http://www.rom.on.ca/" href="http://www.rom.on.ca/" data-cms-ai="1">the Royal Ontario Museum</a> in Toronto, <a title="Link: http://www.msichicago.org/" href="http://www.msichicago.org/" data-cms-ai="1">the Museum of Science and Industry</a>in Chicago, the Isetan Department Store in Tokyo, and the <a title="Link: http://www.nk.se/en/nk-stockholm/" href="http://www.nk.se/en/nk-stockholm/" data-cms-ai="1">NK Department Store </a>in Stockholm. Many of the original paintings can be seen on display at <a title="Link: http://www.worldofcoca-cola.com/" href="http://www.worldofcoca-cola.com/" data-cms-ai="1">World of Coca-Cola </a>in Atlanta, Ga.</p>
